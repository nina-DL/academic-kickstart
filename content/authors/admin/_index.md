I am PhD Candidate in Methodological Statistics at [University of Rome La Sapienza](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/) (Rome, Italy). Currently I am a Visiting Researcher in the [Computer Science Department](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/) of [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) (Ontario, Canada), under the supervision of [Joseph Jay Williams](http://www.josephjaywilliams.com/), where I am also part of the Intelligent Adaptive Interventions lab, and a collaborator MAB based adaptive experiments, such as the [Berkeley DIAMANTE study](https://dheal.berkeley.edu/current-projects/diamante) and the [GoodLife Fitness](www.goodlifefitness.com) project.

From April 2019 to July 2019, I was a Visiting Researcher at the [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg/), specifically at the [Centre for Quantitative Medicine](https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/cqm), [Duke-NUS Medical School](https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/). Here, I worked under the supervision of [Bibhas Chakraborty](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/bibhas/) on Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms applied in Modern Biostatistics.

Prior to my PhD program, I worked as a biostatistician at the [GIMEMA Foundation](https://www.gimema.it/) (Rome), and I have been actively involved in cancer and health-related research projects of the [European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer](www.eortc.org) and the [PROMOTION Registry](http://promotion.gimema.it/).
