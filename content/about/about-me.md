I am a **Postdoctoral Researcher** at the [MRC - Biostatistics Unit of University of Cambridge](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/) (UK), working with [Sofia Villar](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/people/in-alphabetical-order/t-to-z/sofia-villar/) in the [Design and Analysis of Randomised Trials (DART) group](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/research-and-development/dart-design-and-analysis-of-randomised-trials/).
My current research interests lie at the intersection between **biostatistics**, **statistical reinforcement learning & multi-armed bandits**, and **modern adaptive experimentation**.
More specifically, my focus is on using multi-armed bandit strategies for better designing novel trials such as adaptive clinical trials and micro-randomized trials. Additional interests are given to the emergent area of **mobile-Health** and how to optimally design mobile apps for guiding usersâ€™ behavior and improving their health outcomes. The design of such applications involves both the design of the trial itself and the design of the (bandit) algorithm. As such kind of experiments may have a dual goal of improving outcomes for users enrolled into the experiment and learning about the effectiveness of interventions, **estimation and inference in adaptively collected data play a central role in my research arena**.

I did my **PhD in Methodological Statistics** at [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/) (Italy). During my PhD, I spent my time between my home university, and two external universities, which I joined as a **Visiting Research Scholar**. First, the [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg/), specifically at the [Duke-NUS Medical School](https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/), where I worked under the supervision of [Bibhas Chakraborty](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/bibhas/) on Reinforcement Learning (RL) and MABs algorithms applied in Modern Biostatistics. Second, the Computer Science Department of [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) (Canada), under the supervision of [Joseph Jay Williams](http://www.josephjaywilliams.com/), where I am also part of the **Intelligent Adaptive Interventions Lab**, and a collaborator of Multi-armed bandits (MABs) based adaptive experiments, such as the [Berkeley DIAMANTE study](https://dheal.berkeley.edu/current-projects/diamante) and the [GoodLife Fitness](www.goodlifefitness.com) project.

In a previous life, I worked as a **biostatistician** at the [GIMEMA Foundation](https://www.gimema.it/) (Rome), and I have been actively involved in cancer and health-related research projects, included the [European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer](www.eortc.org) projects and the [PROMOTION Registry](http://promotion.gimema.it/).
