I am an **Assistant Professor** (RTDa) in Statistics at the [MEMOTEF Department](https://web.uniroma1.it/memotef/) of Sapienza University of Rome (IT), and a **long-term visitor** at the [MRC - Biostatistics Unit, University of Cambridge](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/) (UK), where I was a Postdoc in late 2020 --- 2021. 

I collaborate with different academic (and other research) institutions worldwide, most of which I visited during my PhD. The most **active collaborations** include [University of Cambridge](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/), [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg/) and [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/), where I am also part of the [IAI Lab](http://www.josephjaywilliams.com/people). I am in the **editorial board** of [YoungStatS](https://youngstats.github.io/about/), the blog of Young Statisticians Europe (YSE), and curate the [Women in Statistics and Data Science](https://twitter.com/WomenInStat) Twitter account. I am also a member of IMS, ACM and SIS. 

I embrace diverse areas of statistics. My primary research interest lies in exploring and developing statistical methods and theory in the context of **sequential decision-making problems**, intersecting areas of **Statistical Inference**, **Bayesian statistics**, **Reinforcement Learning (RL) & Multi-armed Bandits (MABs)**, and **Adaptive designs / experiments**. More specifically, my current focus is: 1) on using MABs and RL for informing the design of adaptive experiments, in clinical trials and mobile-Health experiments (healthcare, education and other behavioral sciences); and 2) **valid inference in adaptively collected data**. More recently, I become interested in **copula models** for data dependencies. 

My research is inspired by the numerous challenges arising in real-life applications that are characterized by a sequential nature. I strongly believe that the theoretical and methodological progress should go along with the concrete real-world needs, and be *not simply good, but also good for something*.
