I am **PhD Candidate in Methodological Statistics** at [University of Rome La Sapienza](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/) (Italy). 

Currently, I am a **Visiting Researcher** in the Computer Science Department of [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) (Canada), under the supervision of [Joseph Jay Williams](http://www.josephjaywilliams.com/), where I am also part of the **Intelligent Adaptive Interventions Lab**, and a collaborator of Multi-armed bandits (MABs) based adaptive experiments, such as the [Berkeley DIAMANTE study](https://dheal.berkeley.edu/current-projects/diamante) and the [GoodLife Fitness](www.goodlifefitness.com) project.

From April 2019 to July 2019, I was a **Visiting Researcher** at the [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg/), specifically at the [Duke-NUS Medical School](https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/), where I worked under the supervision of [Bibhas Chakraborty](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/bibhas/) on Reinforcement Learning (RL) and MABs algorithms applied in Modern Biostatistics.

In a previous life, I worked as a **biostatistician** at the [GIMEMA Foundation](https://www.gimema.it/) (Rome), and I have been actively involved in cancer and health-related research projects, included the [European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer](www.eortc.org) projects and the [PROMOTION Registry](http://promotion.gimema.it/).
