I am a **Postdoctoral Researcher** in Biostatistics at the [MRC - Biostatistics Unit of University of Cambridge](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/) (UK). Here, I am part of the [Design and Analysis of Randomised Trials (DART) Group](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/research-and-development/dart-design-and-analysis-of-randomised-trials/) and I work with [Sofia Villar](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/people/in-alphabetical-order/t-to-z/sofia-villar/) on developing and improving the statistical methodology for adaptive designs.
More specifically, my focus is on the use of **multi-armed bandit strategies** for designing "more ethical" trials (i.e., with participants benefits) such as adaptive clinical trials and micro-randomized trials, a key feature of the emergent **mobile-Health** area. As such kind of experiments may have a dual (and competing) goal of improving outcomes for trial participants and learning about the effectiveness of interventions, **estimation and inference in adaptively collected data** play a central role in my research arena. 

I also actively collaborate with [Bibhas Chakraborty](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/bibhas/) and [Joseph Jay Williams](http://www.josephjaywilliams.com/) on other theoretical reinforcement learning works or more applied projects, respectively. Research questions include how to optimally design mobile apps for guiding users’ behavior and improving their health outcomes, or how to conduct educational experiments for improving students' performance.
