I am an **Assistant Professor** (RTDa) in Statistics at the [MEMOTEF Department](https://web.uniroma1.it/memotef/), Sapienza University of Rome (IT). Previously, I was a Postdoc in Biostatistics at the [MRC - Biostatistics Unit, University of Cambridge](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/) (UK), where I am currently a long-term Visitor. 

My research interests lie at the intersection between **Bayesian statistics**, **biostatistics**, **statistical reinforcement learning (RL) & multi-armed bandits (MABs)**, and **adaptive experiments / designs**.
More specifically, my focus is: 1) on using MABs and RL for informing the design of (adaptive) clinical trials and other digital **mobile-Health** experiments (in healthcare, education and other behavioral sciences); and 2) **inference in adaptively collected data**. 

I actively collaborate with academic and other research institutions worldwide, including [University of Cambridge](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/), [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg/) and [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/).
